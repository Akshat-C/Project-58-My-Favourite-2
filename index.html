            <hr class="line">
            <p>I am 12 years old and I live in Sydney, Australia. I study in grade 6. I have numerous hobbies which I do to pass time. Some of them are: playing Minecraft, reading, coding, watching TV and playing cricket. My favourite hobby is playing Minecraft. I like it because there are no restrictions in what you do, I can create almost anything I want and whenever I achieve something I get extremely happy.</p>
